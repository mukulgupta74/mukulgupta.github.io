        <p>Welcome! My name is <b>Mukul Gupta</b>.
        </p>I am a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant working at LSE's <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM"> Centre for Macroeconomics</a>. I work for <a href="https://mdoepke.github.io/index.html"> Matthias Doepke</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/janeolmsteadrumsey/"> Jane Olmstead-Rumsey</a> on topics in macro and family economics.
        <p>I obtained my Masters in <a href="https://econ.wisc.edu/"> Economics</a> from the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I have also been a Frédéric Bastiat Fellow and Don Lavoie Fellow at the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/"> Mercatus Center</a>, George Mason University for the academic years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 respectively.
        <p>During my masters', I worked as a part-time Research Assistant with <a href="https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/"> Menzie Chinn</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/louphoucoulibaly"> Louphou Coulibaly</a> on topics in macro and international economics.     
        <p>In my earlier life, I have worked as an associate in sell-side equity research and investment management with J.P. Morgan for 5 years.
        <p>My main research interests are in macro and international economics, and one potential area of interest is to explore how macroeconomic fluctuations in the developed world spillover to emerging economies.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The paper leverages a structural VAR model with block exogeneity restrictions to identify the impact of a U.S. monetary policy shock and other external shocks on key macroeconomic indicators in emerging market economies. The paper finds that external shocks - such as a shock to commodity prices, U.S. real economy or U.S. monetary policy - are important sources of variation for emerging market economies. Within this, a U.S. monetary policy shock is less impactful compared to other external shocks for a typical emerging market, and a pivot to unconventional monetary policy measures in the Zero Lower Bound era has not contributed to this result. Policymakers in such economies are largely concerned with the stabilization of the country’s local currency following the shock, and act to counter the effects from changing interest rate and growth differentials. However, there exists heterogeneity in emerging markets policymakers’ response to the same external shock. For those emerging markets for which a U.S. monetary policy shock is a big source of disturbance, local monetary authorities prioritize output and labour market goals over currency stabilization.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The paper extends the work by Swanson (2021) which separately identifies the federal funds rate, forward guidance and large scale asset purchases shocks for each FOMC announcement from July 1991 to June 2019, and uses these to examine the impact of a shock in monetary policy on the term structure of the yield curve. The paper finds that a linear fit fails to provide statistically significant results for the causal link between unconventional monetary policy measures and nominal interest rates beyond ten days of FOMC announcements. Further, it finds that a non-linear fit excels at this task and is able to provide sizeable, persistent and statistically significant causal links between each type of monetary policy shocks and nominal interest rates. In particular, a policy rate shock, forward guidance shock and large scale asset purchases shock have predictive powers for short duration treasury yields, medium-to-long duration treasury yields and the shape of the yield curve respectively for upto 120 days following a FOMC announcement.
