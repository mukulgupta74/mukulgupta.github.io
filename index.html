        <p>Welcome! My name is <b>Mukul Gupta</b>.
        </p>I am a Pre-doctoral Research Assistant working at LSE's <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM"> Centre for Macroeconomics</a>. I work for <a href="https://mdoepke.github.io/index.html"> Matthias Doepke</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/janeolmsteadrumsey/"> Jane Olmstead-Rumsey</a> on topics in macro and family economics.
        <p>I obtained my Masters in <a href="https://econ.wisc.edu/"> Economics</a> from the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I have also been a Frédéric Bastiat Fellow and Don Lavoie Fellow at the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/"> Mercatus Center</a>, George Mason University for the academic years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 respectively.
        <p>During my masters', I worked as a part-time Research Assistant with <a href="https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/"> Menzie Chinn</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/louphoucoulibaly"> Louphou Coulibaly</a> on topics in macro and international economics.     
        <p>In my earlier life, I have worked as an associate in sell-side equity research and investment management with J.P. Morgan for 5 years.
        <p>My main research interests are in macro and international economics, and one potential area of interest is to explore how macroeconomic fluctuations in the developed world spillover to emerging economies.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The paper leverages a Structural Vector Autoregressive model with a non-recursive identification scheme to identify the impact of external shocks - such as a shock to global commodity prices, U.S. output, prices or monetary policy - on key macroeconomic indicators in Emerging Market Economies. The paper finds that external shocks are important sources of variation for Emerging Market Economies. Among external shocks, a U.S. monetary policy shock has a weaker impact relative to others for some Emerging Markets such as India, South Korea, Philippines and Brazil. This result is consistent with results from studies prior to the Zero Lower Bound era, and it suggests that low nominal interest rates and pivot to unconventional monetary policy measures has not contributed to the low relevance of a U.S. monetary policy shock to these Emerging Markets. Policymakers in these economies are largely concerned with the stabilization of the country’s local currency following the shock, and act to counter the effects on currency from changing interest rate and growth differentials. However, there exists heterogeneity in Emerging Markets policymakers’ response to the same external shock. For Emerging Markets - such as Indonesia, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, Russia - for which a U.S. monetary policy shock is a big source of disturbance, local monetary authorities prioritize output and labour market goals over currency stabilization.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The paper extends the work by Swanson (2021) which separately identifies the federal funds rate, forward guidance and large scale asset purchases shocks for each FOMC announcement from July 1991 to June 2019, and uses these to examine the impact of a monetary policy shock on asset prices. In contrast to recent studies (Duffie (2010), Fleckenstein et al. (2014)), this paper finds that the impact of unconventional monetary policy on asset prices is persistent. In particular, a policy rate shock, forward guidance shock and large scale asset purchases shock have predictive powers for short duration treasury yields, medium-to-long duration treasury yields and the shape of the yield curve respectively for upto 120 days following a FOMC announcement. This is an improvement from Swanson (2021), which shows persistence in the impact of policy shocks on asset prices for upto 10 days following the FOMC announcement.
