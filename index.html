                <b>Abstract:</b> The paper leverages a structural VAR model with block exogeneity restrictions to identify the impact of a U.S. monetary policy shock and other external shocks on key macroeconomic indicators in emerging market economies. The paper finds that external shocks - such as a shock to commodity prices, U.S. real economy or U.S. monetary policy - are important sources of variation for emerging market economies. Within this, a U.S. monetary policy shock is less impactful compared to other external shocks for a typical emerging market, and a pivot to unconventional monetary policy measures in the Zero Lower Bound era has not contributed to this result. Policymakers in such economies are largely concerned with the stabilization of the country’s local currency following the shock, and act to counter the effects from changing interest rate and growth differentials. However, there exists heterogeneity in emerging markets policymakers’ response to the same external shock. For those emerging markets for which a U.S. monetary policy shock is a big source of disturbance, local monetary authorities prioritize output and labour market goals over currency stabilization.
